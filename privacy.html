                <p>If you hear from us, we will always aim to be respectful, relevant and appropriate. If at any time you don’t feel we’ve lived up to our philosophy, please let us know straight away by getting in touch with us.</p>

                <p>We may collect, use and share your personal information as is necessary for us to make the Site available in accordance with the Terms and Conditions, to improve your user experience, and as is necessary to progress any enquiry you make. We will only use personal information for our purposes in a manner permitted by relevant data protection legislation, including for the provision of our services and, where you have consented, for marketing purposes.</p>

                <p>This statement explains our privacy and data protection practices. When you use the Site, some information is automatically retrieved by your browser if you choose to accept cookies. This is not used to identify any individual user or passed on to any third party. However, if you register as a member on the Site or subscribe to our newsletter, you will be asked to provide us with your contact details and other details relating to your business. The information that is collected from you on registration will be passed on to third parties in certain circumstances, as set out in this privacy policy. Please see the “Will we use your information for marketing?”, “How else will we use your information?” and “Will we share your information with anyone else?” sections below for further information.</p>

                <p>We may collect data from you including your name, address, telephone number and email address.</p>

                <p>We collect information mainly when you sign up, when you provide us with information within the Site and when you use products and services made available on the Site.</p>

                <h3 class="h3-responsive" id="how-else-will-we-use-your-information">HOW ELSE WILL WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>

                <p>We may also use your information for the following purposes:</p>

                <p>To help us make the Site available to you and to help us provide related services to you (please see the “Will we share your information with anyone else?” section below for more information);</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>To make the Site more relevant for you and our other visitors. This includes sometimes requesting personal information from you to help us run and develop our website and related services;</li>
                  <li>To carry out occasional surveys and to analyse our user base — ultimately we want to ensure that the Site provides everything that you are looking for;</li>
                  <li>To respond to your questions and customer service queries;</li>
                  <li>To carry out research, analysis and write reports to understand our Site and how to make it better;</li>
                  <li>To check whether you are eligible for a competition and to contact you if you win; or</li>
                  <li>To comply with the law.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>We will keep records of any agreements you enter into with us or services or products you receive for up to six years, save to the extent that we are required to hold records for a longer period in order to comply with applicable law. This is so that we can comply with our legal and regulatory obligations and respond to any complaints or disputes that may arise in that period. Please see the “How long do we keep hold of the information?” section below for our retention policy for personal information.</p>

                <h3 class="h3-responsive" id="how-long-do-we-keep-hold-of-the-information">HOW LONG DO WE KEEP HOLD OF THE INFORMATION?</h3>

                <p>There are certain reasons that we have to keep hold of some of your information. Naturally we keep your information while you are registered with us but we also keep some information after you’ve stopped working with us, though only for as long as we need it. How long we keep it depends very much on the type of information we are holding and the purpose for which we need it. We also have to take into account our legal obligations in respect of that data. You can request that we delete your personal information at any time.</p>

                <h3 class="h3-responsive" id="will-we-share-your-information-with-anyone-else">WILL WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH ANYONE ELSE?</h3>

                <p>We may share your information only if you specifically request us to.</p>

                <p>We are required to do so to comply with the law or with the directions of the courts or other authorities; or it helps our trusted third party service providers to provide and improve our service to you or to carry out surveys and user analysis to understand your needs and preferences. We require these service providers to keep your personal information safe and secure. These trusted third parties would only be permitted to use your personal information for the purposes we specify.</p>

                <p>As at the date this policy was last updated (see above), these third party service providers include:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Enhanced Society</li>
                  <li>Coin Fabric</li>
                </ul>

                <p>We won’t ever rent or sell our user’s details to any other organisation or individual.</p>

                <h3 class="h3-responsive" id="how-will-we-make-sure-our-site-is-secure">HOW WILL WE MAKE SURE OUR SITE IS SECURE?</h3>

                <p>We follow strict security procedures as to how your personal information is stored and used, and who sees it, to help stop any unauthorised person getting hold of it. All personal information you register on this Site will be located behind a firewall. We take security extremely seriously but as no system is 100% secure, we can’t completely guarantee the protection of your personal information, any more than any other organisation can. For that reason we can’t accept any liability for the loss, theft or misuse of the personal information which you’ve registered on this website if there is a security breach. However, we will take the appropriate measures to respond to and manage any incident, as required by data protection legislation. This includes taking measures to contain the incident, to recover the information, assessing the risks and notifying those affected.</p>

                <h3 class="h3-responsive" id="will-we-be-transferring-any-personal-information-outside-the-eea">WILL WE BE TRANSFERRING ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION OUTSIDE THE EEA?</h3>

                <p>The data that we collect from you may need be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (EEA). For example, your information may need to be processed by staff who work for us but operate outside the EEA. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, analysing and profiling the use made by you (and other users) of our Site. We may also transfer your data to a company based outside the EEA for other reasons (e.g. if our hosting company is based in the US). Countries outside the European Union may have a lower standard of protection for personal information than that required by EU data protection laws. If we transfer your data to a company based outside the EEA, we will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy and EU law.  Please see the table of our suppliers in the “Will we share your information with anyone else?” section above for whether they are based inside or outside the EU.</p>

                <p>If you would like to see the terms of any of our supplier agreements, please get in touch with us at the address below and we will share these with you provided that we are not prevented from doing so by obligations of confidentiality.</p>

                <p>Our Site may contain links to other websites. Obviously, we don’t have any control over them and take no responsibility for any information you give them. Other sites have different privacy and security policies, which we advise you to read.</p>
